23 September 1999 - efs-1.0d - ajs [interim]

Temporarily worked-around a bug where reading a file from an efs cd
sometimes resulted in a small number of blocks containing data from
other blocks in the buffer cache. This is _not_ a permanent fix -
I'm still hoping to find out why this happens rather than leaving
the kludge at the end of file.c in place. Thanks to
Mark H. Wilkinson <mhw@kremvax.demon.co.uk> for reporting this.

Various other minor cleanups.


14 September 1999 - ajs

Added check for fs_cgisize in super.c - <ankry@green.mif.pg.gda.pl>.

Updated patch.linux-2.2. Hopefully the contents of this patch will
shortly form part of a 2.2 kernel.


18 May 1999 - ajs

<R.E.Wolff@bitwizard.nl> noted that the compiler is not guaranteed to
align int32_t on 32-bit boundaries, and that there were some cases in the
on-disk structs where this was being assumed.


13 May 1999 - ajs

Made EFS less noisy on startup.


9 May 1999 - ajs

Added directory name sanity check - <ankry@green.mif.pg.gda.pl>.


2 May 1999 - efs-1.0 - ajs [released]

Added KERN_* macros to all printk()s.


29 April 1999 - ajs

Minor changes to efs_lookup() for linux 2.2.7. Previous kernels will
probably issue warnings when compiling dir.c.

Added documentation for CONFIG_EFS_FS in the kernel patch. Supplied by
<ralf@uni-koblenz.de>.

Updated kernel patch to separate out SGI disklabel option.


19 April 1999 - efs-0.99 - ajs [released]

Final patch cleanups.


18 April 1999 - ajs

Found a buffer that wasn't being brelse()d in super.c - <willy@bofh.ai>.
Various other efs_read_super() cleanups - <willy@bofh.ai>.
Makefile hackery - <willy@bofh.ai>.
Converted patch.* into unified diffs.


17 April 1999 - ajs

Update for linux-2.2.6.

NEWS: The genhd.c patch is now in 2.2.6 and later kernels.


15 April 1999 - ajs

There appears to be no good reason to flag a warning where a directory
has more than one extent. printk()s removed.


13 April 1999 - ajs

Fixed block and character device handling. Pipes also tested.

There is still a bug in the block/char device handling. Search
for "BUG" in inode.c for more details. This bug cannot be resolved
until linux 2.3 development starts.

Fixed bug in directory handling. It seems that IRIX marks deleted
directory entries by setting dirblock->space[slot] to zero.

Cosmetic cleanups.


12 April 1999 - efs-0.98 - ajs [released]


8 April 1999 - ajs

Fixed potential bug when reading filesystem objects of zero length.


7 April 1999 - ajs

Added kernel versioning check.

Cleaned up #include statements.


2 April 1999 - ajs

Vastly improved handling of indirect extents in inode.c.

Better partition type detection.


1 April 1999 - ajs

Removed references to &(inode->u.generic_ip) and &(super->u.generic_sbp)
in the kernel-patch version of efs.

Removed a couple of unnecessary constants.

Copied volume header checksum verification code from drivers/block/genhd.c
to efs_validate_vh().

Fixed some Makefile brokenness.

NEWS: The fixes to genhd.c are now in kernel patches, starting with 2.2.5-ac2.
      They will apparently make it into 2.2.6.


31 March 1999 - efs-0.97 - ajs [released]

Fixed efs_statfs() to return more sensible values.

Updated the initialisation functions.

Produced a kernel patch for 2.2 kernels.


30 March 1999 - ajs

Reimplemented efs_readdir() to deal with directories with missing entries
in a more sensible manner.


29 March 1999 - ajs

Implemented handling of hard disk partitions. Small changes necessary
in ${LINUX}/drivers/block/genhd.c to enable the use of sgi_partition()
on little-endian machines. See the README.

The endianness code now deals with an array of unsigned chars,
since apparently the endianness of bitfields is undefined.

Reorganised the include files in preparation for integration into
/usr/src/linux/fs/efs.


28 March 1999 - efs-0.96 - ajs [not released]

Attempted to optimise the functions in inode.c to perform inode
read-ahead. System crashes ensued.


26 March 1999 - ajs

Updated endian handling. The icky code necessary for the conversion of
efs_extent for little-endian machines is now wrapped up in one function
at the start of inode.c.

The "IRIX 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4 S2MP Recommended/Required Patches" CD contains
symbolic links. symlink.c is now tested and bug-fixed.

Added TODO and HISTORY.


24 March 1999 - efs-0.95 - ajs [released]

Complete rewrite of efsmod-0.6 for linux-2.2.

Improved the handling of raw data blocks (type conversion into structs).
efs-0.95 is also `endian-clean'.
